# Script of the discipline LEDA

- This repository seeks to guide JAVA students who wish to know the operation of certain data structures and their respective complexity;
- This repository contains the following folders:

## R01-01-Rot-SimpleSorting-Simultaneous-Bubble-environment
- This folder deals with sorting algorithms by comparison:
  * BubbleSort;
  * SelectionSort;
  * InsertionSort.
- The complexity of them revolves around O(nÂ²), and there is no use of auxiliary structures.

## R02-01-Rot-RecursiveSorting-3-way-Quicksort-environment
- This folder deals with recursive sorting algorithms:
  * QuickSort;
  * MergeSort.
- The complexity of them revolves around O(n.log(n)), and there may or may not be the use of auxiliary structures.

## R03-01-Rot-LinearSorting-Countingsort-environment
- This folder deals with linear sorting algorithms:
  * CountingSort;
  * ExtendedCountingSort.
- The complexity of them revolves around O(n), and there is the use of auxiliary structures.

## R04-01-Rot-Sorting-Gnome-and-Comb-environment
- This folder deals with variations of sorting algorithms:
  * GnomeSort;
  * CombSort.
- The complexity of them revolves around O(n.log(n)), and there may or may not be the use of auxiliary structures.

## R05-01-Rot-Stack-CircleQueue--environment
- This folder deals with simple insertion structures:
  * Stack;
  * Queue.
- Presents the methods of inserting, searching, deleting, size, among others.

## R06-01-Rot-Linked-list-iterative-approach-environment
- This folder deals with a single and double linked list with iterative approach:
  * Single Linked List;
  * Double Linked List;
  * Queue Double Linked List;
  * Stack DOuble Linked List.
- All content quoted is iteratively modeled and presents all the methods of a linked list.

## R07-01-Rot-Linked-list-recursive-approach-environment
- This folder deals with a single and double linked list with recursive approach:
  * Recursive Single Linked List;
  * Recursive Double Linked List;
  * Stack Recursive Double Linked List.
- All content quoted is recursively modeled and presents all the methods of a linked list.

## R08-01-Rot-HashTable-AdrClosed-environment
- This folder deals with a closed adress of HashTable and your methods:
  * Hash Table Closed Adress.
- The present class contains the methods: getPrime(), insert(), remove(), search(), indexOf().
